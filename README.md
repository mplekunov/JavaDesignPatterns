# Learning about Java Design patterns

As per the original reference book - Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software there are 23 design pattern
which can be classified under 3 main categories:

* Creational Patterns
* Structural Patterns
* Behavioral Patterns

This repo is just going to be a compact reference about design patterns and, most likely, it's going to contain some implementation of those patterns in Java.
I will add all new information I learn about into wiki.

Who I am writing all of these to? Definitely to myself because I'm a bit bored.
